> Lunar Surface Operations: Real-Time Collaboration

This project is a response to the 2021 NASA Space Apps Challenge
[Lunar Surface Operations: Real-Time Collaboration](https://2021.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/statements/lunar-surface-operations-real-time-collaboration/details)

The goal of this challenge is to create an application that can
immediately and seamlessly integrate console log information of
many users (at least 100+ users on the same network). Such an
application could be valuable to real-time mission support and
long-term record keeping of future lunar human spaceflight
missions for the benefit of scientific communities and the public.

Your application should allow:

* Multiple simultaneous users creating their own console logs
* Real-time live editing of logs that are viewable to anyone on the same network
* Users to select which logs to view (on demand)
* A user to see his/her own console intermixed with the logs from others selected, which could be arranged by time, 'entry topic,' author, or other attributes
* Console log metadata that includes (at a minimum) a timestamp for every entry and a text entry (an entry could also include images)
* The ability to input sample type, written information including descriptions, time tags, hardware used, along with upload of supporting files (photo, video, and audio)
* The capability to add future input fields including user name, 'console seat/position,’ or other attributes
* Users to tag/link log entries from other authors to their own logs
* Each user to 'officially approve' his/her log once the user is ready. This action will create a permanent unmodifiable log that becomes the official written record for that user's profile

Your application should prohibit:

* Users from overwriting or deleting other user’s inputs
* Application access from unapproved people
